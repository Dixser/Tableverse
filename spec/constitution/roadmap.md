# Roadmap

Features are ordered strictly by **dependency**, not by priority: each
feature below assumes every feature above it is complete, because it either
consumes an interface the earlier feature defines or validates that
interface end-to-end.

## 001 — Platform core

The shared foundation every game plugs into. No specific game ships as
part of this feature. Delivers:

- Identity: nickname + client-side session (`User`), per
  tech-stack.md's Phase 1 identity design.
- Room creation and joining via a private, shareable invite code.
- Seat claiming, including multi-seat claiming gated by
  `Room.allowMultiSeat`, and solo play as a special case of multi-seat
  claiming (one user claims every seat).
- The `Room` state machine (`lobby` / `in_game`), including the
  game-change-resets-seats and match-end-preserves-seats rules.
- Presence and reconnection: per-seat connection tracking, grace-period
  timer, release-by-host, the room-presence broadcast channel, and the
  client-side seat-credentials store in `localStorage`.
- The permissions model (`ROOM_PERMISSIONS` / `canPerform`), enforced on
  every room action.
- Generic wiring for boardgame.io's `Server` (SocketIO transport, pluggable
  `StorageAPI`) and `Client` mounting on the frontend, built against the
  `GameModule` contract — but with no real `GameModule` registered yet
  beyond the test fixture used by the conformance suite.
- The `GameModule` contract itself and the generic conformance test suite
  (`packages/game-core/testing/conformance.ts`), since every subsequent
  feature depends on this contract existing and being correct before any
  game is built against it.

This feature is the dependency root for everything else in this roadmap:
no game can be added until the catalog mechanism, chrome/board split, and
room/seat/presence machinery it plugs into all exist.

## 002 — Tic-Tac-Toe

A minimal, intentionally trivial `GameModule` (2 players, no
`settingsSchema`) whose entire purpose is to validate the platform core's
`GameModule` contract end-to-end: catalog registration, the chrome/board
split, and the conformance suite, before any game with real complexity
(hidden information, phases, multiple settings) is attempted.

If implementing Tic-Tac-Toe requires touching anything in
`packages/server` or `packages/client` outside of its own game module and
its one line in `gamesCatalog`, that is a signal the platform core's
contract has a gap — not something to special-case around.

## 003 — UI Styling

Not part of the original dependency-ordered sequence below — inserted
ahead of it by explicit user priority once feature 002 proved the
`GameModule` contract holds for a real game. Establishes a global
stylesheet for the platform chrome and a per-game CSS convention (scoped,
colocated with each game's `BoardComponent`), validated by fixing
Tic-Tac-Toe's board to render as an actual 3x3 grid. Depends on feature
002 existing (needs a real `BoardComponent` to restyle) but has no
dependency relationship with the hidden-information/settings-game
candidates below — it could equally have been sequenced after either of
them; it was prioritized here purely because the current unstyled UI was
the more pressing problem.

## 004 — Theme Switching

Genuinely dependency-ordered (unlike 003's insertion): this feature adds a
light/dark theme toggle on top of the CSS custom-property design tokens
feature 003 establishes in `global.css`. It cannot be built before 003
exists, since there would be no token layer to swap values on. Explicitly
deferred out of 003's own scope (listed there as a non-goal: "the design
tokens should be reasonable to re-theme later, but no toggle UI is built
now") — this is that deferred work, picked up once a user asked for it.
Planned now (spec.md + plan.md); implementation follows after 003 actually
ships, per the same spec → plan → tasks rhythm as every other feature.

## 005 — Spectator Live View

Not part of the original dependency-ordered sequence — inserted after an
explicit user-requested audit of feature 001's spec.md against its actual
implementation turned up two gaps between what was promised and what was
built (the other is 006, below). Story 5 and AC9 of feature 001's spec.md
promise that a room member with no claimed seat can observe the match live,
mounted as a real boardgame.io spectator (`playerID: undefined`). The
shipped implementation never did this — `GameMount` renders a static
"Spectating…" placeholder instead of a live board, an intentional shortcut
acknowledged at the time in feature 001's own `tasks.md` ("AC9 → covered
structurally rather than by one dedicated test"). This feature closes that
gap: mount a real spectator `Client()` and feed its live state into
`GameMount` the same way a claimed seat's state already is. Depends only on
feature 001's existing `Client`/`GameMount` machinery — no new platform
interface, no game-specific work (validated against Tic-Tac-Toe from
feature 002, the only real game that exists so far).

## 006 — Voluntary Seat Release

Also surfaced by the same feature-001 audit as 005. `leaveSeat` is a fully
working server route and a granted permission for both `host` and `member`
(`ROOM_PERMISSIONS`), and even has a client API wrapper
(`roomApi.leaveSeat`) — but no UI ever calls it. A member who claims a seat
today has no way to give it up themselves; only the host's `manageSeats`
release can free it. This feature just wires the already-built pieces
together: a "Leave seat" control on a seat the current user occupies.
Depends only on feature 001's existing `leaveSeat` action — no new
platform interface.

## 007 — Room Membership: Leave & Kick

New user-requested scope, planned ahead of implementation (not triggered by
the feature-001 audit that produced 005/006, though it lives in the same
"room management was under-built" vein). Two related `Room.members`
mutations, bundled into one feature because they share the same cascade
logic (removing a member also frees every seat they hold — same mechanism,
different trigger):

- A member can leave the room entirely (not just a seat) via a "Leave room"
  button; this unclaims every seat they held.
- The host can kick any other member out of the room entirely; this too
  unclaims every seat the kicked member held. Activates the `kickPlayer`
  permission that has existed in `ROOM_PERMISSIONS` since feature 001 but
  was never wired to a route or UI.

Resolved up front (asked the user rather than guessed, since it's a data-
model decision): the host **cannot** leave the room (no succession logic
needed — `leaveRoom` is member-only); a kicked player **is not** banned and
can rejoin later with the same invite code (no ban-list state to add).

## 008 — Seat Picker UI

Not part of the original dependency-ordered sequence — added by explicit
user request while fixing a solo-play bug in feature 001 (the free-text
"seat number" input in `ClaimSeatForm` made claiming multiple seats
error-prone and gave no indication of how many seats a game actually
has). Replaces the free-text input with one button per seat, from `0` to
`gameModule.maxPlayers - 1`, rendered once a game is selected; clicking
an open seat's button claims it directly. Depends only on feature 001's
existing `claimSeat` action and `GameModule.maxPlayers` — no new
platform interface. Deliberately sequenced after 005/006/007 per user
priority: the room-management gap fixes take priority over this
cosmetic/UX improvement.

## 009 — Gameover Banner

Not part of the original dependency-ordered sequence — inserted by explicit
user request after noticing that no game (including Tic-Tac-Toe) tells a
player anything when a match ends; `BoardComponent`s stop accepting moves on
`ctx.gameover` but nothing renders it. Formalizes `GameoverResult` (the
shape Tic-Tac-Toe's `endIf` already returns, `{ winner }` / `{ draw: true }`)
as a platform-wide contract and adds one generic `GameoverBanner` rendered
by `GameMount`, so every game gets a win/lose/draw message for free without
writing any gameover UI itself. Zero changes to Tic-Tac-Toe's `gameDef.ts`
are required — this only formalizes and consumes a shape that already
exists. Deliberately does **not** attempt genre-shared board widgets (hand
trays, opponent card counts, etc.) — see the discussion at the top of
`009-gameover-banner/spec.md`'s Description for why that's a distinct,
deferred problem: those need a second real game to validate their shape
against, which doesn't exist yet (Love Letter, below, is still unspecced).
Depends only on feature 001's existing `GameMount`/`BoardProps` machinery —
no new platform interface beyond the one type it adds.

## 010 — i18n Support

Not part of the original dependency-ordered sequence — inserted by explicit
user request now that the platform is starting to accumulate enough
platform-chrome surface area (rooms, seats, presence, the gameover banner
from feature 009) to be worth translating before it grows further. Adds
`react-i18next` to `packages/client`, extracts every platform-chrome string
(plus Tic-Tac-Toe's `GameModule`, which turns out to need zero changes — its
`BoardComponent` renders only `X`/`O` marks) into translation keys for
English and Spanish, and adds a manual language switcher that structurally
mirrors feature 004's theme-toggle pattern (a plain hook, a `localStorage`
key, a pre-paint script in `index.html`) rather than introducing a new
Context/Provider pattern. The one genuinely hard part is `GameoverBanner`'s
dynamic, pluralized winner messages (win vs. wins depending on winner
count, interpolated name lists) — handled via i18next's `count`-based
pluralization rather than string concatenation, since concatenation breaks
for languages with different word order. Depends only on feature 004's
existing theme-toggle precedent (structural template, not a code
dependency) and feature 009's `GameoverBanner` (the component being
translated) — no new platform interface.

## 011 — Game Module Scaffolding

Not part of the original dependency-ordered sequence — inserted by explicit
user request, ahead of Love Letter (below), specifically to make adding
Love Letter (and every game after it) start from a generated, compiling
skeleton instead of hand-copied boilerplate. Adds a template
(`packages/game-core/templates/new-game/`) and a small generator script
(`npm run new-game -- <id> "<Display Name>"`) that scaffolds the five files
every `GameModule` needs and prints a checklist of the three registration
points a new module must be wired into by hand (`gamesCatalog.ts`,
`boards.ts`, `boardRegistry.ts` — three, not the one file feature 002's
entry above describes, per a real split introduced by a feature 003
incident; see this feature's own spec.md for why). Deliberately scoped to
the **contract-required plumbing only** — it does not attempt a shared
board UI kit or any rules template narrower than "a trivial valid game,"
both of which stay deferred until a second and third real game exist to
generalize from (see 013, below). Depends only on feature 001's existing
`GameModule` contract and conformance suite — no new platform interface,
no changes to any existing game.

## 012 — Room & Match Chat

Not part of the original dependency-ordered sequence — inserted by explicit
user request. Reverses mission.md's original MVP exclusion ("Spectator
chat or any chat system") now that the platform has enough of a
room/seat/spectator model (features 001, 005) to make chat worth building
against. One merged chat channel per room, carrying both free-text player
messages and system-generated game-status messages (e.g. "Player A is
defeated", "Player C chooses to pass") — with spectator messages filtered
out of seated players' view, so a spectator's commentary can never leak
strategy-relevant chatter to someone still playing. Depends on feature
001's room/member model and feature 005's spectator model; produces the
system-status-message channel that feature 013 (Love Letter) is the first
game to actually populate with real per-move messages.

## 013 — Love Letter

Small hidden-information card game — the next step up in complexity
specifically to exercise `playerView` filtering and the spectator
hidden-information risk called out in tech-stack.md, which Tic-Tac-Toe (no
hidden information) cannot validate. **Also the natural trigger point for
a genre-shared board UI kit** (hand tray, opponent card-count badges)
deferred by feature 009 — once Love Letter exists as a second real
`BoardComponent`, shared pieces should be *extracted* from the two real
implementations, not designed speculatively ahead of them. Would also be
the first real test of feature 010's i18n contract against actual in-board
game text, and the first game whose per-move results are announced through
feature 012's chat system-message channel (e.g. a card-use message split
into a public "Player A used the Baron on Player B" broadcast plus a
private reveal to Player A only — see this feature's own specs for the
public/private split). Two rules editions (Normal, Classic) — see this
feature's own specs for the versioning-heuristic decision on whether that's
one catalog entry with an `edition` setting or two. Depends on feature 001
(seats/rooms), feature 011 (scaffolded from its skeleton), and feature 012
(chat channel for status messages).

## Later candidates (placeholders — not specced yet)

- **014 — TBD**: a game with a configurable `settingsSchema` for a
  non-edition setting (e.g. a house rule or turn timer) — Love Letter's
  `edition` field (013) exercises the settings-form path for a fixed enum
  choice, but not e.g. a numeric/timer-shaped setting, so this placeholder
  remains open for whichever future game needs that shape first.
